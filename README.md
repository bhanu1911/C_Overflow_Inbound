# C_Overflow_Inbound
This repo is intended to work as a walkthrough of sorts for beginners who are just starting out with C. 
These programs have all been indented and verified by multiple users (not on github), so pay close attention.
Wish you all the very best on your journey of code. 
Bon voyage!
